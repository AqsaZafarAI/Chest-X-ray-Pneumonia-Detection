Project Overview: 
The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a serious lung infection, and early detection through X-ray analysis can improve treatment outcomes.

This model is trained using the Chest X-ray dataset, which contains labeled X-ray images categorized as either normal or pneumonia-affected.

Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is the ChestX-ray dataset, which contains the following classes:

Normal: X-ray images of healthy lungs. 
Pneumonia: X-ray images of lungs affected by pneumonia. 
Dataset Structure The dataset is organized into three folders:

train/: Training images. 
val/: Validation images. 
test/: Testing images.

You can download the dataset from the Kaggle Chest X-ray dataset. Dataset link is as: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Model Architecture: 
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, consisting of the following layers:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction. 
MaxPooling layers for downsampling. 
Fully connected dense layers for classification.

Model Summary: 
Input: Chest X-ray images 
Layers: Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense, Dropout 
Activation: ReLU, sigmoid 
Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy 
Optimizer: Adam

Results: 
Training Accuracy: 89% 
Validation Accuracy: 75% 
Test Accuracy: 75% 
Loss: 1.62

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting pneumonia, providing a useful tool for assisting medical diagnosis.
